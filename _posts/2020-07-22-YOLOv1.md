excerpt: A new approach to object detection.Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, Joseph Redmon’s team frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities.

### Abstract
* As a **regression problem** to spatially separated bounding boxes and
associated class probabilities
* A single neural network predicts **bounding boxes** and **class probabilities** directly from
full images in one evaluation
* more localization errors but is less likely to predict
false positives on background

### The YOLO Detection System
![Figure 1](/images/Paper/YOLOv1/figure_1.JPG)
Processing images with YOLO is simple and straightforward
1. resizes the input image to 448 × 448
2. runs a single convolutional network on the image
3. thresholds the resulting detections bythe model’s confidence

### The Model
#### Procedure
1. It divides the image into an S × S grid [448 × 448 -> 7 x 7]
<div style='text-indent:6em'><font size="4" color="#F39C12">If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.</font></div>
