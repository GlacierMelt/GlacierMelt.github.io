### Abstract
* As a **regression problem** to spatially separated bounding boxes and
associated class probabilities
* A single neural network predicts **bounding boxes** and **class probabilities** directly from
full images in one evaluation
* more localization errors but is less likely to predict
false positives on background

### The YOLO Detection System
![Figure 1](/images/Paper/YOLOv1/figure_1.JPG)
Processing images with YOLO is simple and straightforward
1. resizes the input image to 448 × 448
2. runs a single convolutional network on the image
3. thresholds the resulting detections bythe model’s confidence

### The Model
1. It divides the image into an S × S grid
