### Abstract
![Abstract](https://github.com/GlacierMelt/PaperCV/blob/master/Deep%20High-Resolution%20Representation%20Learning%20for%20Visual%20Recognition/images/Abstrack.jpg?raw=true)

***Features***
* High-resolution representations through the whole process
* The resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise

### 1  INTRODUCTION
![introduction](https://github.com/GlacierMelt/PaperCV/blob/master/Deep%20High-Resolution%20Representation%20Learning%20for%20Visual%20Recognition/images/INTRODUCTION.jpg?raw=true)

***There are three versions of HRNet :***

1. *HRNetV1*<br>

	The output is the representation **only** from the high-resolution stream. Other three representations are ignored. This is illustrated in Figure 4 (a).
2. *HRNetV2*<br>
Rescaling the low-resolution representations through bilinear upsampling **without** changing the number of channels to the high resolution and **concatenate** the four representations, followed by a **1 Ã— 1 convolution** to mix the four representations. This is illustrated in Figure 4 (b).
3. *HRNetV2p*<br>
Constructing **multi-level** representations by downsampling the high-resolution representation output from **HRNetV2** to multiple levels. This is depicted in Figure 4 (c).

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1,
                       bias=False)
self.bn1 = BatchNorm2d(64, momentum=BN_MOMENTUM)
self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1,
                       bias=False)
self.bn2 = BatchNorm2d(64, momentum=BN_MOMENTUM)
self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=False)
