### Abstract
![Abstract](https://github.com/GlacierMelt/PaperCV/blob/master/Deep%20High-Resolution%20Representation%20Learning%20for%20Visual%20Recognition/images/Abstrack.jpg?raw=true)
***Features***
* High-resolution representations through the whole process
* The resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise

### INTRODUCTION
![introduction](https://github.com/GlacierMelt/PaperCV/blob/master/Deep%20High-Resolution%20Representation%20Learning%20for%20Visual%20Recognition/images/INTRODUCTION.jpg?raw=true)

*There are three versions of HRNet*

1. HRNetV1
2. HRNetV2
3. HRNetV2p

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1,
                       bias=False)
self.bn1 = BatchNorm2d(64, momentum=BN_MOMENTUM)
self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1,
                       bias=False)
self.bn2 = BatchNorm2d(64, momentum=BN_MOMENTUM)
self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=False)
```
